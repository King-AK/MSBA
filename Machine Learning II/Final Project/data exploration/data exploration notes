given a pair and all their information -except ratings for each other- will they be a match


Baseline stats
	percent of dataset where match occured - 16.44%
	*this means we will need to create a model with a priority on low type II error
	*especially since we can realisitcally get ~85% accuracy by telling a person they wont match
	*need high accuracy on matching people


Drop all f_rate_m and m_rate_f columns.

Eigenvalue PCA
	-f_oppgender_pref_attr correlated with f_genderpref_attr
	-likewise with male counterparts
	-variables on opposing axes


Most people seem to not be able to honestly rate themselves



Parameters for ADA Boost Tree Model
420 Trees
30 Max Depth
Min Split 10
Complexity 0.0250

Rationale - Build many trees, allow them to get deep and have nodes splits based on smaller requirements. However, set complexity high so that there is a limit to the complexity and trees are different. The difference of the trees built helps coax out better guesses.

For a 50/15/35 T/V/Test split, with Male Dec given, the AdaBoost Tree with specs listed gives 6% test error with 80% power on guessing a match on the dataset without racial information, age or categorical variables considered.

For a 50/15/35 T/V/Test split with Female Dec given, the AdaBoost Tree with specs listed gives 10% test error with 70% power on guessing a match on the dataset without racial information, age or categorical variables considered.

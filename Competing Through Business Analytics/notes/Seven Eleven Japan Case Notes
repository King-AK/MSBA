Seven Eleven Japan Case

-Worlds largest convienience store business, approx 38,000 stores as of March 2010
-largest and most profitable retail chain store in Japan, listed in Seven & i Holdings (listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange)
-its leading position was due to innovation on their part in the retail industry

-SEJ soon eclipses Southland Corporation, the preceding leader in convienience stores 
-SEJ saves Southland by purchasing 64.3 percent of the company 

RETAIL STRATEGY SEJ
-67 percent of all customers live within 10 minutes walk of a store
-largely male, single, and between 20 and 39
-customers spent 5-6 minutes in store and brought around 601 yens worth worth of goods per visit
-emphasis on "freshness" and a  "fresh" (rotating?) set of merchandise
-Bento boxes for sale at SEJ and and use of color coding to mark freshness of the boxes for sale. New shipments in everyday, three times a day. 
-Perishables kept for about half the period of other stores
-non-perishables constantly rotated out to give shelf space to new items
-Items quickly retired once employees noticed a decline in sales, and generally retired items earlier than other stores stopped stocking the items

INFORMATION SYSTEMS
-item placement on shelves, when to place items, how many to place to prevent stockouts and overstocking
-obtain high volume products, discontinue poor sellers
-Averaged 39 inventory turns per year in 2009, compared to 8.9 at Walmart
-streamlined ordering process, network allowed store managers to place orders using in-store terminals in 1979 (pretty far ahead of the curve)
-System evolved over time. Recently in 2006, there was installation of a fiber optic network for SEJ in addition to in-store wireless networks
-use of a "location/trade area" database that enabled stores to analyze the sales pattern based on the stores characteristics (e.g. near a school)


IT SYSTEMS CONFIGURATION
-high connectivity of all machines in store. Store computer, register, graphic order terminal, scanner terminals, etc.
-information about sales captured at the register is passed on to headquarters via the fiber optic network
-clerk keys in customer gender and estimated age to supplement sales data
-average of 13 million data points collected per day from all stores collectively
-Store managers can collect real time information on the GOT site including: Hourly sales trends for individual items, Scrap trend analysis, Stockout ranking by item, sales trends for new products, hourly sales trends by customer profile


CONVERTING DATA TO INFORMATION
-use of information to discover when lackluster performance occurs and brainstorming methods to fight it
-september holiday/picnics, should have stockedd more salmon rice balls and apricots
-local factors including weather, temperature, TV Commercials, local events and more are caught in data analysis and have a role in tactics development
-Operation Field Counselors play a vital role in the information feedback loop. They are in charge of 7-8 stores each, they visit each store twice a week or more an deliver messages from corporate HQ and implement tactics recommended for the week at the local level. They report to district managers, who report to zone managers. Chain of command.
-POS = Point of Sale
-Decisions made with the feedback loop included daily ordering, store layout, merchandising, new product development, and new store opening.

	DAILY ORDERING : ordering based on factors like weather, local events, etc in addition to known POS data

	STORE LAYOUT : layout predetermined up to the category level. Milk products rearanged on the shelves several times a day based on the time of day so that customers can easily pick up their favorite choice.

	MERCHANDISING : found that new generation is impatient and easily bored. Products quickly added and deleted from inventory rotations. Freshness concept. MArket leader in fast food sales and second place in paperback sales.

	NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT : use of POS data to forecast future trends and demand data to project future customer needs. Finding trends where certain products sales are going up led to innovation in those products and creation of "original products". Original products represented 59 percent of sales and increased gross margins over the years as a result.

	NEW STORE OPENING: backlog of stores waiting to be opened. New store opening sbased on factors including car and people traffc, population density, average daily sales at new stores in first fiscal year


	LTA Location/Trade Area ANalaysis
	Database kept track of the stores and classified them by physical location, sales patterns, and lta classes including Office/Shopping area, Business, REsidential, Roadside, and Compound Location. Helped in answering numerous questions. Allowed HQ to develop new products for targeted LTAs and stores can fine tune themselves according to their LTA classfication rather than treating all stores the same.

JOINT DELIVERY PRGRAM FROM THE SUPPLIER
-problems with original delivery system
-implementation of a temperature based joint delivery system in 1980s
-average number of deliveries decreased from 40 to 12 per day in 1990 and then 9 per day in 2010. Delivery costs dropped by two thirds and the payback period for the investment was six months
DELVIVERY OPERATIONS
-had to make sure stores arrived right on time, neither too late or too early
-diverse system including motorcycles, ships and helicopters for agility. Benefitted on the day of the Kobe earthquake, which allowed transportation of goods by motorcycle and helicopter when the speed on the Kobe highway dropped to only 2 miles per hour
-Dominant opening strategy


7DREAM
-online website that allowed customers to order online and pick up in store on their walk home during a commute
-saler of books 
-low shipping costs, aggregated with other products at SEJ and shipped by truck

-expansion into China and Southeast Asia with Japan economic slowdown
